	<p>My final favorite summer activity is going to camp.
	<h2>Michigania</h2>
	<p>I go to a family camp in Michigan that I have gone to since I was 2. I have lots of friends there that live in Michigan that I see for one week each summer. At that camp, there is swimming, sailing, archery, riflery, arts and crafts, a ropes course, campfires, and more!</p>
	<h2>Two Rivers</h2> 
	<p>The other camp I go to is two rivers, a soccer camp. There are many camp activities as well as soccer and it is so much fun.</p>
