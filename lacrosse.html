	<p>Lacrosse is one of my favorite summer activities. I like practicing with my team and going to tournaments. Practice is especially fun during the summer because it stays light outside later and is warmer. Lacrosse tournaments are fun because I can spend time with my teammates and do fun activities in addition to playing my favorite sport. I love sprinting down the field, making an assist, scoring a goal, or making a stop on defense and then celebrating with my teammates.</p>
