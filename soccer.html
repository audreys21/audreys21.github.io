	<p>Soccer is another activity that I enjoy during the summertime. There are many day camps that I go to for soccer with my team and we improve while doing drills as well as scrimmaging and doing competitive games. I also go to a sleepaway soccer camp where I get to play soccer with players and coaches from around the world and have a fun camp experience, too. Finally, I also go to soccer tournaments where I can play multiple games in a row.</p>
